## What is GitHub Pages? 
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service provided to you by GitHub, designed to host your pages directly from a GitHub repository. GitHub Pages is a perfect match for our purpose, since everything we need is to host a single index.yaml file along with a bunch of .tgz files.
Why not hosting all this stuff in your own web server? A managed service helps to reduce your operational overhead and risk (think to monitoring, patch management, security, backup servicesâ€¦) so you can focus on code and in what makes your business relevant for your customers.
