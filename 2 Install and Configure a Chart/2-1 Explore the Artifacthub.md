Today, we are happy to announce that the Helm Hub is moving to the Artifact Hub. That means, when you go to the Helm Hub you will be redirected to the Artifact Hub.

Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects.


Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. For example, this could include Helm charts and plugins, Falco configurations, Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies, OLM operators, Tinkerbell actions, kubectl plugins, Tekton tasks, KEDA scalers and CoreDNS plugins.

Discovering artifacts to use with CNCF projects can be difficult. If every CNCF project that needs to share artifacts creates its own Hub this creates a fair amount of repeat work for each project and a fractured experience for those trying to find the artifacts to consume. The Artifact Hub attempts to solve that by providing a single experience for consumers that any CNCF project can leverage.

The project, accessible at https://artifacthub.io, is currently in development in a beta state. Support for Helm charts and plugins, Falco configurations, OPA policies, OLM operators, Tinkerbell actions, kubectl plugins, Tekton tasks, KEDA scalers and CoreDNS plugins is in development with plans to support more projects to follow. Pull requests, especially those to support other CNCF projects, are welcome. Please see CONTRIBUTING.md and dev.md for more details.

Feel free to ask any questions on the #artifact-hub channel in the CNCF Slack. To get an invite please visit http://slack.cncf.io/.
